            <p> The first of these photos was taken as a Buddhist monastery. For me, the young monks
                pose is the most interesting part of the photo. As he slightly adjusts his robe you can see
                something has caught his eye.

                The second photo is a friend who I was with for my trip. In this photo she acrobatically covers
                the lowering sun, creating a great silhoutte.

                The third photo is of a little girl I met while hiking. She lived in a high altitude town.

                Sixth Picture: A guide looks over his shoulder while we leave a high-altitude and spiritually
                important lake in Nepal.
