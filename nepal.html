            <h3> Photo 1: </h3>
            <p> The first of these photos was taken as a Buddhist monastery. For me, the young monks
                pose is the most interesting part of the photo. As he slightly adjusts his robe you can see
                something has caught his eye.
            </p>

            <h3> Photo 2:</h3>
            <p>
                The second photo is a friend who I was with for my trip. In this photo she acrobatically covers
                the lowering sun, creating a great silhoutte.

            <h3> Photo 3:</h3>
            <p>
                The third photo is of a little girl I met while hiking. She lived in a high altitude town.

            <p>
                A friend looking out over the mountains as the sun slowly goes down.

                Friends entertain themselves with a game of pingpong
            </p>

            <h3> Photo 6:</h3>
            <p>
                A guide looks over his shoulder while we leave a high-altitude and spiritually
                important lake in Nepal.
