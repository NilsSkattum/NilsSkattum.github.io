        <h3> Why Photography?</h2>

        <p>Photography has always been a source of interest for me. While never a truly artistic person, I gravitated towards photography and
            and its unique ability to capture life as is. What always strikes me about photography is that there is the creative and artistic side but
            but also the experiential side. The photographs of places all over the world, of war-torn countries, or magical moments in the animal kingdom
            take people to those places and make them feel things. 

        </p>

        <h3>My Equipment</h2>

        <p> 
            I used an Olympus E-M5 Mark III. Honestly, what drew me to this camera was its simplicity and the almost vintage
            appearance it has. It's a solid camera with several high-level functions for a serious photographer as well as some 
            more basic features which allow easy functionality. 
        </p>

        <h3>My Inspiration</h2>

        <p> 
            I had never taken a photography class before I bought my Olympus. No experience and no idea what I was doing. 
            In fact, the only reason I bought the camera was because I was heading to Nepal for a gap year and felt as if 
            I would regret not developing the photographic skills to capture the experience. I never anticipated truly getting into photography
            but on my first day I met someone who told me that a camera is not just to remember the moment but instead a third eye that never forgets...
